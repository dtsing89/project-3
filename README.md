# project_3
###### Team Names: David Tsing, Lina Larson, Brett Schneider

## comments or assumptions
###### 1) If a casual customer does not get all their items they count as unfulfilled.
###### 2) If a casual customers item is out they do not replace it with a different type.
###### 3) We assumed right away to use the decorator pattern for the extra stuff.
###### 4) 

## Issues
###### 1) Handling all of the random events, IN the different customers, rolls, fillings.
###### 2) Applying the observer pattern was confusing because it wasn't clear who was the observer, and who was the observable.
###### 3) 

## Instructions to run code
###### 1) Download the code or copy the workspace using " git clone https://github.com/dtsing89/project_3 " in your comand line/ terminal.

###### 3) See that we finished the project with minimal tears.
